\title{Bridge profiles of a node across communities}
\usage{
find_bridge_communities(fit, node)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class \code{mixMN_fit} containing at least:
\itemize{
\item \code{$graph$keep_nodes_graph}: character vector of node names (graph vertex set);
\item \code{$statistics$edge$true}: data.frame with columns \code{edge} ("a--b") and \code{weight} (signed).
\item (optional) \code{$communities$groups}: named factor with communities for a subset of nodes.
}}

\item{node}{Character scalar: node of interest; must belong to
\code{fit$graph$keep_nodes_graph}.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{\code{strength}}{list with \code{overall} (numeric) and \code{by_comm} (tibble: \code{community}, \code{sum_abs_w}).}
\item{\code{ei1}}{list with \code{overall} and \code{by_comm} (tibble: \code{community}, \code{sum_signed_w}).}
\item{\code{ei2}}{list with \code{overall} and \code{by_comm} (tibble: \code{community}, \code{sum_signed_w2}).}
\item{\code{closeness}}{list with \code{overall} and \code{by_comm} (tibble: \code{community}, \code{inv_mean_dist}).}
\item{\code{betweenness}}{list with \code{overall} and \code{by_pair} (tibble: \code{Ci}, \code{Cj}, \code{hits}).}
}
}
\description{
For a given node, compute how strongly it "bridges" to \emph{other}
communities using five profiles:
\itemize{
\item \strong{strength}: sum of \eqn{|w|} to nodes in other communities
\item \strong{ei1}: signed sum of \eqn{w} to nodes in other communities
\item \strong{ei2}: signed influence \eqn{A + A^2} to nodes in other communities
\item \strong{closeness}: \eqn{1 /} mean shortest-path distance to nodes in other communities;
paths computed on \eqn{|W|} with edge length \eqn{1/|w|}
\item \strong{betweenness}: number of inter-community \emph{shortest paths}
(same graph as for closeness, but \emph{unweighted} in the path search)
that pass through the node as an \emph{intermediate} (path multiplicity is counted)
}
}
\details{
Notes:
\itemize{
\item The signed adjacency \eqn{W} is rebuilt \emph{exactly} from \code{fit$statistics$edge$true}
(symmetric, diagonal set to 0).
\item "Other communities" means targets whose community differs from the
node's community; if the node is unassigned (NA), targets are all assigned nodes.
\item Betweenness counts \emph{per path} (multiplicity). Endpoints are always
\emph{assigned} nodes in \emph{different} communities. The focal node may be
assigned or unassigned; it is counted only as intermediate (never as endpoint).
