}
\arguments{
\item{wadj_signed}{Square numeric matrix with signed edge weights
(rows/columns = nodes). Typically \code{wadj * signs} from \pkg{mgm}.}

\item{nodes}{Character vector of node names (must match
\code{rownames(wadj_signed)} and \code{colnames(wadj_signed)}).}

\item{exclude_from_graph}{Character vector of nodes to exclude entirely
from the graph (no edges, no centralities).}

\item{exclude_from_cluster}{Character vector of nodes to exclude only
from clustering (they remain in the graph, but have no community label).}

\item{cluster_method}{Community detection algorithm, one of
\code{c("louvain","fast_greedy","infomap","walktrap","edge_betweenness")}.}

\item{reps}{Integer; number of bootstrap replications. Currently not used
inside this function, but saved in \code{$settings$reps} for consistency
with \code{mixMN()} and downstream bootstrap utilities.}

\item{seed_boot}{Optional integer; bootstrap seed, stored in
\code{$settings} but not used here.}

\item{treat_singletons_as_excluded}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, communities
of size 1 are treated as "excluded" (their nodes receive \code{NA}
community labels).}

\item{boot_what}{Character vector specifying which quantities are meant
to be bootstrapped in higher-level functions:
can include \code{"general_index"}, \code{"interlayer_index"},
\code{"bridge_index"}, \code{"excluded_index"}, \code{"community"},
\code{"community_scores"}, or \code{"none"}. The value is stored in
\code{$settings$boot_what} but no bootstrap is computed here.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{c("mixmashnet","mixMN_fit")} with:
\describe{
\item{\code{graph}}{List with: \code{igraph} (signed network),
\code{keep_nodes_graph}, and \code{keep_nodes_cluster}.}
\item{\code{communities}}{List with empirical community structure
(\code{original_membership}, \code{groups}), color palette
(\code{palette}), and empty \code{boot_memberships}.}
\item{\code{statistics}}{Node-level metrics in
\code{$statistics$node$true} (strength, EI1, closeness, betweenness,
bridge metrics, including "excluded" versions) and edge weights in
\code{$statistics$edge$true}. Bootstrap slots
(\code{$statistics$node$boot}, \code{$statistics$edge$boot},
\code{$statistics$node$ci}, \code{$statistics$edge$ci}) are set to
\code{NULL}.}
\item{\code{community_scores}}{Empty containers (\code{obj}, \code{df},
\code{ci}, \code{boot}) for eventual community scores.}
\item{\code{settings}}{List echoing the main arguments
(\code{reps}, \code{cluster_method}, \code{exclude_from_graph},
\code{exclude_from_cluster}, \code{treat_singletons_as_excluded},
\code{boot_what}).}
}
}
\description{
Low-level constructor that computes clustering, centrality, and bridge
metrics from a signed weighted adjacency matrix. It returns a
\code{mixMN_fit} object analogous a quello prodotto da \code{mixMN()},
ma stimato direttamente da \code{wadj_signed} invece che da \code{mgm()}.
The arguments \code{reps}, \code{seed_boot}, and \code{boot_what} are
stored in \code{$settings} for compatibility with bootstrap-based
functions, but no bootstrap is performed inside this function.
}
\details{
Centrality indices are computed on the signed matrix \code{wadj_signed}
(via \code{qgraph::centrality}), while distances for closeness and
betweenness are based on \eqn{|w|} with edge length \eqn{1/|w|}. Bridge
metrics are computed separately on the absolute and signed graphs using
\code{bridge_metrics()} and \code{bridge_metrics_excluded()}.
