\title{Safe graph assembly for mgm outputs (modified from \pkg{mgm})}
\usage{
Reg2Graph_safe(mgmobj, thresholding = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mgmobj}{An object produced by a nodewise \pkg{mgm}-style routine.}

\item{thresholding}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, applies the thresholding rule recorded in
\code{mgmobj$call$threshold}.}
}
\value{
The input object with populated \code{$pairwise} matrices and interaction lists.
}
\description{
Robust post-processing to assemble the pairwise (and nodewise) weighted adjacency
matrices from an \code{mgm}-style object. This variant tolerates masked designs
and empty parameter blocks by using conservative fallbacks and \code{na.rm = TRUE}
where appropriate. It preserves the structure of the original \pkg{mgm} output.
