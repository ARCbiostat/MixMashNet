\title{Bridge metrics for nodes across communities}
\usage{
bridge_metrics(g, membership)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object with edge attribute `weight`.}

\item{membership}{Named vector/factor of community labels for a subset of nodes (names must match `V(g)$name`).}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns: node, cluster, bridge_strength, bridge_ei1, bridge_ei2, bridge_betweenness, bridge_closeness.
}
\description{
Computes bridge centrality measures for nodes with an assigned community.
Specifically, the function computes bridge strength as the sum of absolute
edge weights connecting a node to nodes in other communities; bridge expected
influence of order one (EI1) as the signed sum of direct connections to nodes
in other communities; bridge expected influence of order two (EI2) as the
signed influence that propagates indirectly to nodes in other communities
via one intermediate neighbor (i.e., through paths of length two);
bridge betweenness as the number of times a node lies on shortest paths
between nodes belonging to different communities; and bridge closeness as the
inverse of the mean shortest-path distance to nodes in other communities.
}
\details{
Bridge betweenness and closeness are computed on the positive-weight subgraph
only, with weights converted to distances as \eqn{d = 1/w}.
Bridge centrality measures implemented in this function follow the bridge
centrality framework proposed by Jones implemented in the
\pkg{networktools} package.
