\title{Bridge metrics for nodes across communities (original-style)}
\usage{
bridge_metrics(g, membership)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object with edge attribute \code{weight}.}

\item{membership}{Named vector/factor of community labels for a subset of nodes (names must match \code{V(g)$name}).}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns: node, cluster, bridge_strength, bridge_ei1, bridge_ei2, bridge_betweenness, bridge_closeness.
}
\description{
Computes bridge centralities for nodes with an assigned community:
\itemize{
\item bridge_strength: sum of absolute weights to nodes in other communities
\item bridge_ei1: signed expected influence to nodes in other communities
\item bridge_ei2: community-weighted expected influence (networktools-like)
\item bridge_betweenness: # times a node lies on shortest paths between different communities
\item bridge_closeness: inverse mean distance to nodes in other communities
}
}
