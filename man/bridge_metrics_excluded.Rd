\title{Bridge metrics for nodes excluded from communities}
\usage{
bridge_metrics_excluded(g, membership)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An \code{igraph} graph. If edge attribute \code{weight} is missing,
unweighted adjacency (1 for edges, 0 otherwise) is used.}

\item{membership}{A named vector/factor of community labels for a subset of nodes;
names must match \code{V(g)$name}. Nodes not present here are treated as excluded ("Z").}
}
\value{
A data.frame with rows = excluded nodes and columns:
\code{node}, \code{bridge_strength}, \code{bridge_closeness},
\code{bridge_betweenness}, \code{bridge_expected_influence1},
\code{bridge_expected_influence2}, \code{cluster}.
}
\description{
Computes bridge centrality metrics for nodes that are \strong{not} assigned to any
community (treated as cluster "Z"). Uses \code{networktools::bridge} on the
full weighted adjacency matrix with a community vector where unassigned
nodes are labeled "Z".
}
\details{
Returns, for excluded nodes only:
\itemize{
\item \code{bridge_strength}
\item \code{bridge_closeness}
\item \code{bridge_betweenness}
\item \code{bridge_expected_influence1} (1-step)
\item \code{bridge_expected_influence2} (2-step)
}
