\title{Bridge metrics for nodes excluded from communities}
\usage{
bridge_metrics_excluded(g, membership)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An \code{igraph} graph. If edge attribute \code{weight} is missing,
unweighted adjacency (1 for edges, 0 otherwise) is used.}

\item{membership}{A named vector/factor of community labels for a subset of nodes;
names must match \code{V(g)$name}. Nodes not present here are treated as excluded.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns: node, bridge_strength, bridge_closeness, bridge_betweenness,
        bridge_expected_influence1, bridge_expected_influence2, cluster.
}
\description{
Computes bridge centrality measures for nodes that are not assigned to any
community. For these excluded nodes, the function computes bridge strength, bridge
closeness, bridge betweenness, and bridge expected influence of order one and
two (EI1 and EI2), quantifying their role in connecting nodes across different
communities.
}
\details{
Bridge betweenness excluded and closeness excluded are computed on the positive-weight subgraph
only, with weights converted to distances as \eqn{d = 1/w}.
Bridge centrality measures implemented in this function follow the bridge
centrality framework proposed by Jones implemented in the
\pkg{networktools} package.
