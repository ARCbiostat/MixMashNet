\title{Plot method for MixMashNet objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mixmashnet}(x, what = c("network", "intra", "inter", "stability"), layer = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{mixmashnet}, as returned by
\code{mixMN()} or \code{multimixMN()}.}

\item{what}{Type of plot to produce. One of
\code{c("network","intra","inter","stability")}.
If missing, a default is chosen based on the presence of
centrality-related arguments and on whether \code{x} is single-layer
or multilayer (see Details).}

\item{layer}{Optional layer name. For \code{what = "intra"} or
\code{what = "stability"} on a \code{multimixMN_fit} object, this selects
which layer-specific fit to use. If \code{NULL}, the behaviour depends
on \code{what}:
\itemize{
\item \code{what = "network"}: plots the global multilayer network;
\item \code{what = "intra"} or \code{"stability"} on multilayer:
either all layers are plotted in a combined layout or an error
is raised if the context is ambiguous.
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying helpers:
\itemize{
\item For \code{what = "intra"}: forwarded to \code{plotCentrality()},
e.g. \code{statistics}, \code{ordering}, \code{standardize},
\code{edges_top_n}, \code{exclude_nodes}, \code{color_by_community}.
\item For \code{what = "inter"}: forwarded to \code{plotInterlayer()},
e.g. \code{statistics}, \code{pairs}, \code{edges_top_n},
\code{ordering}, \code{standardize}, \code{nodes_layer}.
\item For \code{what = "stability"}: forwarded to
\code{membershipStab_plot()}, e.g. \code{title}.
\item For \code{what = "network"}: forwarded to internal network
plotting helpers \code{.plot_network_single()} or
\code{.plot_network_multi()}, e.g. \code{color_by},
\code{edge_color_by}, \code{vertex_size}.
}}
}
\value{
For \code{what != "network"}, a \code{ggplot} object is returned.
For \code{what = "network"}, the corresponding network plotting helper
is called for its side-effect and \code{x} is returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Unified plotting interface for objects returned by \code{mixMN()} and
\code{multimixMN()}. Depending on \code{what}, it can:
\itemize{
\item \code{what = "network"}: plot the estimated network
(single-layer or multilayer);
\item \code{what = "intra"}: plot intra-layer node/edge statistics with
95\\% bootstrap CIs (centrality and bridge metrics);
\item \code{what = "inter"}: plot interlayer node metrics or interlayer
edge weights with 95\\% bootstrap CIs (multilayer only), via
\code{plotInterlayer()} and the chosen \code{statistics};
\item \code{what = "stability"}: plot node stability within communities
based on bootstrap community assignments.
}
}
\details{
When \code{what} is missing, the function inspects \code{...} to decide
whether the user is requesting centrality/edge statistics (e.g., by
passing \code{statistics}, \code{ordering}, etc.). In that case:
\itemize{
\item for single-layer fits, the default is \code{what = "intra"};
\item for multilayer fits, an informative error is raised if neither
\code{what} nor \code{layer} is specified and the request is
ambiguous (intra-layer vs interlayer statistics).
}
