\title{Plot method for MixMashNet objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mixmashnet}(x, what = c("network", "intra", "inter", "stability"), layer = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{mixmashnet}, as returned by
\code{mixMN()} or \code{multimixMN()}.}

\item{what}{Type of plot to produce. One of
\code{c("network","intra","inter","stability")}.}

\item{layer}{Optional layer name. For \code{what = "intra"} or
\code{what = "stability"} on a \code{multimixMN_fit} object, this selects
which layer-specific fit to use.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying helpers:
\itemize{
  \item For \code{what = "intra"}: forwarded to \code{plotCentrality()},
        e.g. \code{statistics}, \code{ordering}, \code{standardize},
        \code{edges_top_n}, \code{exclude_nodes}, \code{color_by_community}.
  \item For \code{what = "inter"}: forwarded to \code{plotInterlayer()},
        e.g. \code{statistics}, \code{pairs}, \code{edges_top_n},
        \code{ordering}, \code{standardize}, \code{nodes_layer}.
  \item For \code{what = "stability"}: forwarded to
        \code{membershipStab_plot()}, e.g. \code{title}.
  \item For \code{what = "network"}: forwarded to internal network
        plotting helpers \code{.plot_network_single()} or
        \code{.plot_network_multi()}, e.g. \code{color_by},
        \code{edge_color_by}, \code{vertex_size}.
}}
}
\value{
If \code{what != "network"}, the function returns a \code{ggplot} object.
If \code{what = "network"}, the network is plotted directly.
}
\description{
Unified plotting interface for objects returned by \code{mixMN()} and
\code{multimixMN()}. Depending on \code{what}, it can:
\itemize{
  \item \code{what = "network"}: plot the estimated network
        (single layer or multilayer);
  \item \code{what = "intra"}: plot intralayer node/edge statistics with
        bootstrap quantile regions at the level stored in the object (centrality and bridge metrics);
  \item \code{what = "inter"}: plot interlayer node metrics or interlayer
        edge weights with bootstrap quantile regions at the level stored in the object (multilayer only),
        and the chosen \code{statistics};
  \item \code{what = "stability"}: plot node stability within communities
        based on bootstrap community assignments.
}
